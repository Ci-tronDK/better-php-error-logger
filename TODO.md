//Remove new line after ob_end_contens in php ✓ Changed to rtrim so only last whitespace gets removed.


- Make so you can use string like template literals and when you do that you can choose to use double quotes.
- Make so error_log will be printed better places, not right after function and arrays. ✓ Or before statement closes, so after ;. Or in html. Also place things correctly when deleting.
- Change var_dump settings a little.

Change to typescript. Continue with that.
Change how indentation works, so it finds where log is going to be inserted.
Change readme totally.
Maybe select multiple variables and print as array.
Change where error messages are located.
Make so you can use output buffer with other shortcuts.
Log before return of variable is after return.
Find out of you can see if you are inside a function or block.
