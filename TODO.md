//Remove new line after ob_end_contens in php ✓ Changed to rtrim so only last whitespace gets removed.


- Make so you can use string like template literals and when you do that you can choose to use double quotes.
- Make so error_log will be printed better places, not right after function and arrays. Or before statement closes, so after ;.
- Maybe print output buffer get_contents
- Shortcut to delete all error_logs (maybe echos), call stack.

 Change to typescript.
